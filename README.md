# Higher Order Functions 
HOF are functions which take functions as input and/OR return functions as output. 
If we have more than one function(s) with some common functionality , the idea is to abstract that into a HOF and let these two functions be sent in as param. 

Its similar to Utility function being written OOP world but with a subtle (but important) difference that unlike in OOP, HOF acts as a control logic ie its this HOF which executed the functions and not otherway round....
